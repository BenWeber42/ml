Preprocessing
key1, key2, key3

Features
key1, key2, key3

Model
key1, key2, key3

Description
Verbose and detailed description of preprocessing, features, model and
other things that are helpful to understand what was done exactly.
E.g. if key1 = histogram for features, then the description might look
like this: "We divide the image into 7x7x7 blocks and make a histogram
with 10 bins for each of them. These histograms are then concatenated
into a vector"
