1) Load training & test data and flatten.
2) Remove zero valued voxels.
3) Normalize the data (zero mean and unit variance).
4) In oder to reduce data dimensionality, apply PCA.
5) Project the data on the first 50 principal dimensions.
6) Train an SVM (with RBF kernel) classifier by using 
cross-validation, and optimize C and gamma parameters.
7) Predict targets for the test data by using the optimized
classifier.

In addition to PCA and SVM, we tried various classifiers
and dimensionality reduction techniques which can be found
in the code. Other configurations can be simply activated
by changing the corresponding flags.
